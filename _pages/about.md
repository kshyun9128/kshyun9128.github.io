I am a PhD student conducting research in the [Vision and Machine Learning lab.](https://sites.google.com/view/vmllab) 

My research focuses on `medical AI and explainable AI`. I am interested in research for `medical image analysis`(Segmentation, Deformable Image Registration) and `robust AI`(Adversarial Defense).

Additionally, I am interested in developing `OpenGL-based 3D graphics` to improve visualization techniques and support medical image analysis in clinical applications.
